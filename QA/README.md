# Type of tests

- Unit tests (written by developer)
- Smoke testing (general health check up)
- Regression testing (verification that no new bugs are introduced)
- Sanity testing (subset of regression testing, narrow, checking if bug is fixed)
- Functional testing (focus on feature, functionality, black box)
- Integration testing (integration between different units/parts/modules)
- System testing (whole system)
- Acceptance testing (client perspective, before releasing, delivering to the customer)
- Exploratory testing

#### Smoke tests

**SMOKE TESTING**, also known as “Build Verification Testing”, is a type of software testing that comprises of a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring that the most important functions work. The result of this testing is used to decide if a build is stable enough to proceed with further testing.

- *non-exhaustive*
- *critical functionalities*

#### Functional testing

**FUNCTIONAL TESTING** is a type of software testing whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements/specifications.
Functions (or features) are tested by feeding them input and examining the output. Functional testing ensures that the requirements are properly satisfied by the application.

- *Black Box testing* - focus on expected functionalities to work as expected

Steps:

- Identify functions that the software is expected to perform.
- Create input data based on the function’s specifications.
- Determine the output based on the function’s specifications.
- Execute the test case.
- Compare the actual and expected outputs.
